Road Document Listing Inquiry: Information on roads and other right-of-way parcels may be obtained by one of the links under the Road Document Listing.  You must have either an 11-digit parcel number or the recorded document number to use the Road Document Listing transaction.  You can also obtain the Road Document Listing in either of the Assessor's Office locations.
